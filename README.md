### README for Stroke Prediction Model

#### Project Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python-based machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of stroke in individuals based on various health parameters. The model utilizes several Python libraries to process data, perform analysis, and predict outcomes. This document provides a detailed walkthrough of each step in the project to ensure that even those new to Python can understand and run the model successfully.

#### Prerequisites
Before running the model, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

#### Repository Contents
- `model.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that contains the full code, detailed commentary, and visualization outputs.
- `Dataset.csv`: The dataset used in this model.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview and guide on how to use the resources in this repository.

#### Detailed Explanation and Code
1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**
   Start by importing all required libraries for handling data, preprocessing, and modeling.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
   from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
   from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
   from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
   ```

2. **Loading the Dataset**
   Load the data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('Dataset.csv')
   ```

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Handling Missing Values:**
     Replace 'Other' in 'smoking_status' with NaN for consistency in missing data handling.
     ```python
     df['smoking_status'] = df['smoking_status'].replace('Other', np.nan)
     ```
   - **Visualizing Data:**
     Plot the distribution of stroke outcomes in the dataset.
     ```python
     plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
     sns.countplot(x='stroke', data=df)
     plt.title('Stroke Count Distribution')
     plt.show()
     ```
   - **Encoding Categorical Data:**
     Use one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into a form suitable for machine learning models.
     ```python
     categorical_columns = ['gender', 'ever_married', 'work_type', 'Residence_type']
     transformer = ColumnTransformer([('one_hot_encoder', OneHotEncoder(), categorical_columns)], remainder='passthrough')
     X = transformer.fit_transform(df.drop('stroke', axis=1))
     y = df['stroke']
     ```
   - **Splitting the Dataset:**
     Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
     ```python
     X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
     ```
   - **Handling Missing Values:**
     Fill in missing values with the mean value of each column.
     ```python
     imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
     X_train = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
     X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)
     ```
   - **Standardizing Features:**
     Normalize the features to ensure they contribute equally to the model training process.
     ```python
     scaler = StandardScaler()
     X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
     X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
     ```

4. **Model Training**
   Train the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier, a simple yet effective model for classification tasks.
   ```python
   nb = GaussianNB()
   nb.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

5. **Model Evaluation**
   Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using accuracy and a confusion matrix to assess the performance.
   ```python
   y_pred = nb.predict(X_test)
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
   print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
   plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
   sns.heatmap(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred), annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues')
   plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
   plt.xlabel('Predicted')
   plt.ylabel('Actual')
   plt.show()
   ```
