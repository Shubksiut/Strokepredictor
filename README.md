pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

#### Code Breakdown
1. **Importing Libraries**
   - Libraries for data handling, plotting, and machine learning.

2. **Loading Data**
   - Load your dataset using pandas:
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('Dataset.csv')
   ```

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Replace unspecified smoking statuses with NaN.

4. **Visualizing Data**
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Preparing data for the model with encoding, splitting, imputing, and scaling.

6. **Model Training**
   - Train a Naive Bayes Classifier:
   ```python
   nb = GaussianNB()
   nb.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model using various metrics and visualize performance with a confusion matrix.

#### Running the Model
Execute the script where all dependencies are installed. Ensure the dataset is properly located.

#### Conclusion
This repository provides tools and instructions for learning about stroke prediction with machine learning, suitable for all skill levels.
