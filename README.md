### README for Stroke Prediction Model

#### Overview
This project involves creating a Python-based machine learning model to predict strokes. The code and processes described below cater to users with varying levels of Python proficiency, explaining key concepts and operations in a simple and accessible manner.

#### Setting Up the Environment
To run the code, you need Python installed along with several libraries:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations
- `sklearn` for machine learning tasks

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

#### Code Breakdown
1. **Importing Libraries**
   - **Pandas and NumPy** are used for handling data. 
   - **Matplotlib and Seaborn** are for creating plots.
   - Various components from **Scikit-learn** handle data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Loading Data**
   - We use `pandas` to load a CSV file containing the dataset.
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('Dataset.csv')
   ```

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and other anomalies in data, like replacing unspecified smoking statuses with NaN (a standard missing value marker).

4. **Visualizing Data**
   - Visualizations help understand the distribution of data, such as the number of stroke cases.

5. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms.
   - **Splitting Data**: Divides the dataset into training and testing subsets.
   - **Imputing Missing Values**: Fills missing values with the mean (average) of the respective column.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes the range of the features.

6. **Model Training**
   - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem.
   ```python
   nb = GaussianNB()
   nb.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Displays a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the classification model.

#### Running the Model
To run this model, execute the Python script in an environment where all dependencies are installed. Make sure the dataset `Dataset.csv` is in the same directory as your script, or provide the correct path to the file.

#### Conclusion
This repository provides all the necessary tools and instructions for anyone interested in learning about stroke prediction using machine learning, regardless of their prior Python knowledge. It's a hands-on way to understand data handling, preprocessing, and basic principles of machine learning.
